#### Protecting Seniors and Fighting Financial Exploitation

This past session, Rep. Turner helped pass legislation to protect senior citizens from financial exploitation.  Under this bill, anyone convicted of exploiting seniors will be ordered to pay restitution to victims indefinitely for medical treatment and counseling.  House Bill 1689 has been sent to the Governor for his signature.

#### Protecting Patients’ Rights

Rep. Turner worked to pass Illinois’ new Patients’ Right to Know Act, to ensure that a physician’s professional history is made available to consumers.  The legislation requires the creation of a searchable Internet database with information on all of Illinois’ 44,000 licensed physicians. Convictions for felonies or other serious crimes, disciplinary actions, license revocations and medical malpractice judgments will be available so that patients can make informed decisions. House Bill 105 was sent to the Governor for his signature.
