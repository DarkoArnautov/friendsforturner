#### About Arthur Turner

As State Representative of the 9th District in Illinois, my number one goal is to effectively communicate with my constituents so that I can be a strong voice in Springfield for the needs of our district.

Our state is facing serious challenges and it is important that we work together for solutions.  To help improve the quality of life in our communities, I will be a strong advocate for job growth in our area while fighting to bring back funding from Springfield.  I will also work hard to make our neighborhoods safer, improve educational opportunities for our children, and make government more accessible to the public.

It is a privilege to represent the 9th District and I am committed to always working on behalf of our communitiesâ€™ best interests.  I look forward to hearing from you about your concerns or ideas for how we can improve our state.
